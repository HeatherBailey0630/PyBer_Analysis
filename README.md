# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

Utilized PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze rideshare data and showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders. The dataframes and charts created can be used to improve affordability and access for underserved neighborhoods. The cities were categorized into three types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. 

## Results

### Rides
 - Rural: 125 rides
 - Suburban: 625 rides
 - Urban: 1625 rides

## Analysis

Total Rides Per City Type: There were far more rides in Urban cities than in rural cities with Urban cities having 1500 more total rides.

Total Drivers: Urban cities have a total of 2,327 more drivers than rural cities.

Sum of Fares: Urban cities have far greater overall total fares at $39,854.38, compared to rural cities at $4327.93.

Average Fares: Rural cities have a significantly higher fare per driver, and slightly higher fare per ride than Urban cities. 

We have otwo significant findings from this data. Although there are dramatically more drivers, rides, and sum of all fares in the Urban cities, the average fares per driver and per ride are significantly higher in Rural cities. One could assume that this is due to geography. Typically rural cities are more spread out, and people have to travel farther distances to get from A to B. Therefore, each ride is more expensive. In Urban areas, individuals typically travel short distances for short periods of time, but do so more often, and at a much higher volume. Additionally, it appears April has the lowest
